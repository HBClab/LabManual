## Introduction

This wiki is intended to be a resource base for background reading and lab protocols.

### What does the lab do?

Our lab is interested in understanding how to maximize the brain’s capacity for adaptive plasticity across the lifespan. In other words, how to get the most out of your brain as you get older. This includes examining mechanisms associated with declines in plasticity and cognitive function associated with aging, injury, or disease, and determining how we may intervene for improved performance and quality of life. To study plasticity, we are interested in how people learn new skills and abilities, and the lifestyle factors that affect learning and retention. For example, what is the best way to learn how to play the piano? How can we improve our memory for the people we meet and new knowledge we've learned over time? What brain processes support this learning and how do they change throughout the lifespan? Is there anything we can do to improve our ability to learn and remember? Do they differ when we’re thirty compared to seventy? We are particularly interested in cognitive abilities important for successful aging, such as episodic memory, working memory, processing speed, task-switching, and different types of skill learning.

More specifically, our research goals relate to __three broad questions__:

1. __Aging brain and cognition__: How do the brain and cognition change across the lifespan? What are the competing forces of "damage" and "resilience" and how can their process and outcome be measured in testable forms in humans? See this [figure](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Ferrucci-2018-Fig2.png) from [Ferrucci et al, 2018](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Ferrucci-2018-Time%20and%20the%20Metrics%20of%20Aging.pdf) as a visual of these competing  forces which are biological at their root and become phenotypic when they are observable/measurable (e.g., cognitive performance, cardiorespiratory fitness).

2. __Translation__: What are the earliest signs of brain and cognitive decline that are most predictive of functional decline and/or risk for neurodegenerative disease? We hope this work helps define biomarkers that are in the causal pathway of later functional or neurodegenerative decline. These help capture personalized assessment of risk and tracking change over time. Think of this as working our way back to the biological root of changes we later want to prevent, like in this [figure](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Ferrucci-2018-Fig3.png) from [Ferrucci et al, 2018](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Ferrucci-2018-Time%20and%20the%20Metrics%20of%20Aging.pdf) showing the relationship over time of biological, phenotypic, and functional changes with aging.


3. __Neuroplasticity for improved function__: What factors or interventions associate with or maintain brain health and in turn, cognition and everyday function? Here we take what we've learned about the processes of aging and the most predictive markers of age-related functional decline, and determine how to prevent or reverse them through processes of neuroplasticity. The majority of our research on this question examines the impact of how to regularly challenge our brains and bodies to maintain optimal performance throughout life, as shown by this [figure](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Clark-Chapter-Fig1.png) from [Clark et al 2018](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/hippocampus-cells-to-systems_clark_final.pdf) We are also interested in how other lifestyle factors, such as sleep and nutrition, affect the potential for neuroplasticity. Key background for this research can be read in Dan Simon's [review of cognitive training](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Simons-2016-Do-Brain-Training-Programs-Work.pdf), and our review on exercise neuroscience ([paper](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Voss-et-al-TICS-2019.pdf), [supplementals](https://github.com/HBClab/LabManual/blob/master/key-background/Voss2019-supplemental-updated.pdf)).


To do this, we use __cognitive neuroscience methods__. For example, we study learning with both basic learning and memory paradigms and applied training experiences such as commercialized “brain training” programs and videogames. To understand neural mechanisms of brain plasticity and cognitive function, we use primarily magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. We use MRI often because it is the only tool to look at functional brain systems throughout the whole brain at once. MRI data is collected at [MRRF](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/mri/), which is a short 10-12 minute walk from our lab in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Building (PBSB). To help narrow in on the most useful imaging measures collected with MRI, we collaborate to examine mechanisms of cognitive and brain function using other imaging modalities (e.g., ECoG) and species.

#### Data scoring, entry, and processing Conduct

- Respect that you are working on hard-earned, confidential data
  - Our lab members worked hard on it
  - The participants worked hard to participate in our studies
  - Take care in scoring and entering data with precision, all the hard work of your lab-mates and participants goes to waste if we don’t enter the data properly!
  - Don’t hesitate to ask a question if you’re unsure how to code or proceed with something
    - If no one is around, email Professor Voss, the lab manager, or the coordinating graduate student or post-doc
    - If no one can answer your question, we’ll discuss it as a group at a lab meeting and try to come up with a good solution
- Don’t leave data folders with confidential information sitting out unattended
- If the data sheet you’re working on is shared among several lab mates, always save and close the data sheet when you’re done
  - You will almost always save it back to where you opened it from
  - If you have any questions about whether to overwrite previous versions or to save a new version with your progress, ASK!

#### Before Session

- Be a qualified assessment leader by completing training on how to lead the session
- Be prepared!
  - Know what study and session you are running
  - Bring study protocol for reference
  - Have phone numbers of lab members
- Come 15 min before session
  - Prepare participant paperwork
  - Gather folder and other necessary items

#### During Session

- Greet participant, do your best to refer to each participant by name
- Introduce yourself and confirm their name and appointment type
- Be professional, polite, respectful, and patient at all times
- Ask for help from other lab members if you need it!

#### After Session

- Thank the participant for coming in
- Fill out the payment form and remind them a check will come shortly; they should call us if it doesn’t
- Ask if they remember how to get out so you can help if not (they don’t take offense in my experience)
- Put folders and session materials away


## Session Training Protocol

Trainer is expected to conduct the following sessions before the trainee is qualified to run sessions independently. Trainee is required to read this protocol to understand training expectations during all training sessions. An example training log is shown below, the trainer is required to record date, Pass/Fail, and initial after each training session. Only when the trainee completes all four training sessions successfully will trainee be considered fully qualified to independently run sessions. If there are sessions that are the same between studies, trainee is considered qualified upon completing training for the session for one of the studies. If sessions are similar but not the same, trainee still must complete training, but the training session may be modified.

### Who can be a "trainer"

- Professor Voss
- Lab manager
- Graduate student or post doc overseeing the study
- Anyone judged by Professor Voss or the lab manager to have run a sufficient number of sessions in the study

#### Session 1 - Protocol Meeting

- Trainer will go over the protocol of the session with trainee in a demonstration form
- Trainee is expected to have thoroughly read the protocol and ask questions
- It may be helpful for the this session to end with the trainee walking through the steps, as a way to generate questions

#### Session 2 - Shadowing

- Trainee will shadow a trained subject runner
- This should be scheduled within one week of the protocol meeting
- Trainee should arrive 15 minutes early and be prepared for session
- Trainee should introduce them self to the participant and tell them that they will be shadowing the session

#### Session 3 - Paired Practice

- Trainee will practice the session with another trainee or trained subject runner
- Trainee should treat this as if it were an actual session
- Practice partner does not need to actually do the tasks, but trainee is expected to instruct practice partner through all tasks, even those on the computer
- Practice partner should interrupt if something has been done not to protocol and correct trainee

#### Session 4 - Observed Session

- Trainee will administer a session with a trained subject runner observing the session
- Trainee will be expected to conduct session as if the observer was not present
- Trainee will introduce observer to participant by saying “This is \<name\> he/she will be observing my performance in this session today”

## Background Literature

### Guide to reading and contributing to literature reviews

Below is a list of topics separated and outlined by topic. Some are general interest topics and others relate specifically to the methods and research questions relevant to our lab.

As part of the lab, we want you to be both a consumer and producer of this page. To consume and get the most out of your reading, please read the reading questions and consider these for each review or primary article that you read. It's expected that you'll run into questions, so don't be shy to contact someone in the lab to discuss your answers to reading questions. This includes other undergraduates in the lab, the graduate student or staff you work with most, and Professor Voss. To produce and generate new information on these pages, you should:

(1) Consult with a graduate student or Professor Voss to find out about which topic(s) are priority

(2) Search for new papers; we often use PubMed or Google Scholar (see here if you're not sure how to do this)

(3) Pick a set of 1-2 papers to read that may be relevant to your search topic; answer reading questions as you read each, and document answers on the reading response form (which you can download below). Note you may have to skim more papers than you actually read in depth. I would suggest once you find a promising abstract, to skim to make sure it's relevant.

(4) Make an appointment to discuss the articles with the graduate student you're working with or Professor Voss (whoever you first consulted with). Facilitate discussion by sending PDFs of the articles and your responses, as this will be a guide for discussion. 

(5) Once we're ready to add an article, email a PDF of the article(s) to Professor Voss, along with the final (electronic) copy of the reading response form(s). Professor Voss will update the wiki.

#### Reading questions

Journal articles are the way scientists communicate their ideas and results to one another. The dissemination of hypotheses and findings in this way is fundamental to the process of progress in science because it maintains rigor (through peer-review) while also making new research publicly available to other labs that may try to replicate or extend the published studies in their own lab. Thus, the ability to read and interpret articles in the primary literature, both in terms of methods and results and the conclusions/interpretations that can be drawn, is a fundamental skill for a successful scientist. These questions are meant to help critically analyze research articles, so you can evaluate when a paper is a good contribution to the literature, i.e., it creates new knowledge.

## Coding Jumpstart

We are excited that you want to pick up the basics for learning to code and help out
with some of the more technical aspects of data collection and analysis.
Persistance is key, but Professor Voss and the graduate students will be here to help you along your journey.
If you are a graduate student, then more senior graduate students will help.
What I will outline below are some soft suggestions of what to learn about;
everyone may have different resources that "click" for them, so stick to what helps you.
With that said, there does not exist a resource that makes anything "easy"; there is not
a replacement for persistance and asking for help when you get stuck.
