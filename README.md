## Introduction

This wiki is intended to be a resource base for background reading and lab protocols.

### What does the lab do

Our lab is interested in understanding how to maximize the brain’s capacity for adaptive plasticity across the lifespan. This includes examining mechanisms associated with declines in plasticity and cognitive function associated with aging, injury, or disease, and determining how we may intervene for improved quality of life. To study plasticity, we are interested in how people learn new skills and abilities, and the lifestyle factors that affect learning and retention. For example, what is the best way to learn how to play the piano? What brain processes support this learning and how do they change throughout the lifespan? Is there anything we can do to improve our ability to learn? Do they differ when we’re thirty compared to seventy? We are particularly interested in studying cognitive abilities important for successful aging, such as multi-tasking, working memory, processing speed, and explicit and implicit skill learning.

More specifically, our research goals relate to three questions.

1. Aging brain and cognition: How do the brain and cognition change across the lifespan?

2. Translation: What impact do age-related changes in the brain and cognition have on everyday function?

3. Inform and intervene: What factors or interventions associate with or improve brain health and in turn, cognition and everyday function?

To do this, we use cognitive neuroscience methods. For example, we study learning with both basic learning and memory paradigms and applied training experiences such as commercialized “brain training” programs and videogames. To understand neural mechanisms of brain plasticity and cognitive function, we use primarily magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. MRI data is collected at MRRF, which is a short 10-12 minute walk from Psychology.

#### Data scoring, entry, and processing Conduct

- Respect that you are working on hard-earned, confidential data
  - Our lab members worked hard on it
  - The participants worked hard to participate in our studies
  - Take care in scoring and entering data with precision, all the hard work of your lab-mates and participants goes to waste if we don’t enter the data properly!
  - Don’t hesitate to ask a question if you’re unsure how to code or proceed with something
    - If no one is around, email Michelle, the lab manager, or the coordinating graduate student or post-doc
    - If no one can answer your question, we’ll discuss it as a group at a lab meeting and try to come up with a good solution
- Don’t leave data folders with confidential information sitting out unattended
- If the data sheet you’re working on is shared among several lab mates, always save and close the data sheet when you’re done
  - You will almost always save it back to where you opened it from
  - If you have any questions about whether to overwrite previous versions or to save a new version with your progress, ASK!

#### Session Running Conduct

| Expectations for interactions with participants |                                                                                                                                                                  Examples                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                 Accountability                                                                                 |

Feedback opportunities from participants on their experience (good and bad) |

#### Before Session

- Be a qualified subject runner by completing subject runner training
- Be prepared!
  - Know what study and session you are running
  - Bring study protocol for reference
  - Have phone numbers of lab members
- Come 15 min before session
  - Prepare subject paperwork
  - Gather folder and other necessary items

#### During Session

- Greet subject, do your best to call them by name
- Introduce yourself and confirm their name and appointment type
- Be professional, polite, respectful, and patient at all times
- Ask for help from other lab members if you need it!

#### After Session

- Thank the subject for coming in
- Fill out the payment form and remind them a check will come shortly; they should call us if it doesn’t
- Ask if they remember how to get out so you can help if not (they don’t take offense in my experience)
- Put folders and session materials away

### Subject Runner Training Protocol

Trainer is expected to conduct the following sessions before the trainee is qualified to run sessions independently. Trainee is required to read this protocol to understand training expectations during all training sessions. An example training log is shown below, the trainer is required to record date, Pass/Fail, and initial after each training session. Only when the trainee completes all four training sessions successfully will trainee be considered fully qualified to independently run sessions. If there are sessions that are the same between studies, trainee is considered qualified upon completing training for the session for one of the studies. If sessions are similar but not the same, trainee still must complete training, but the training session may be modified.

#### Who can be a "trainer"

- Michelle
- Lab manager
- Graduate student or post doc overseeing the study
- Anyone judged by the lab manager to have run a sufficient number of sessions in the study

#### Session 1 - Protocol Meeting

- Trainer will go over the protocol of the session with trainee in a demonstration form
- Trainee is expected to have thoroughly read the protocol and ask questions
- It may be helpful for the this session to end with the trainee walking through the steps, as a way to generate questions

#### Session 2 - Shadowing

- Trainee will shadow a trained subject runner
- This should be scheduled within one week of the protocol meeting
- Trainee should arrive 15 minutes early and be prepared for session
- Trainee should introduce them self to the participant and tell them that they will be shadowing the session

#### Session 3 - Paired Practice

- Trainee will practice the session with another trainee or trained subject runner
- Trainee should treat this as if it were an actual session
- Practice partner does not need to actually do the tasks, but trainee is expected to instruct practice partner through all tasks, even those on the computer
- Practice partner should interrupt if something has been done not to protocol and correct trainee

#### Session 4 - Observed Session

- Trainee will administer a session with a trained subject runner observing the session
- Trainee will be expected to conduct session as if the observer was not present
- Trainee will introduce observer to participant by saying “This is \<name\> he/she will be observing my performance in this session today”

## Background Literature

### Guide to reading and contributing to literature reviews

Below is a list of topics separated and outlined by topic. Some are general interest topics and others relate specifically to the methods and research questions relevant to our lab.

As part of the lab, we want you to be both a consumer and producer of this page. To consume and get the most out of your reading, please read the reading questions and consider these for each review or primary article that you read. It's expected that you'll run into questions, so don't be shy to contact someone in the lab to discuss your answers to reading questions. This includes other undergraduates in the lab, the graduate student or staff you work with most, and Michelle. To produce and generate new information on these pages, you should:

(1) Consult with a graduate student or Michelle to find out about which topic(s) are priority

(2) Search for new papers; we often use PubMed or Google Scholar (see here if you're not sure how to do this)

(3) Pick a set of 1-2 papers to read that may be relevant to your search topic; answer reading questions as you read each, and document answers on the reading response form (which you can download below). Note you may have to skim more papers than you actually read in depth. I would suggest once you find a promising abstract, to skim to make sure it's relevant.

(4) Make an appointment to discuss the articles with the graduate student you're working with or Michelle (whoever you first consulted with). Facilitate discussion by sending PDFs of the articles and your responses, as this will be a guide for discussion. 

(5) Once we're ready to add an article, email a PDF of the article(s) to Michelle, along with the final (electronic) copy of the reading response form(s). Michelle will update the wiki.

#### Reading questions

Journal articles are the way scientists communicate their ideas and results to one another. The dissemination of hypotheses and findings in this way is fundamental to the process of progress in science because it maintains rigor (through peer-review) while also making new research publicly available to other labs that may try to replicate or extend the published studies in their own lab. Thus, the ability to read and interpret articles in the primary literature, both in terms of methods and results and the conclusions/interpretations that can be drawn, is a fundamental skill for a successful scientist. These questions are meant to help critically analyze research articles, so you can evaluate when a paper is a good contribution to the literature, i.e., it creates new knowledge.

### Reading topic areas

## Coding Jumpstart

We are excited that you want to pick up the basics for learning to code and help out
with some of the more technical aspects of data collection and analysis.
Persistance is key, but Michelle and the graduate students will be here to help you along your journey.
If you are a graduate student, then more senior graduate students will help.
What I will outline below are some soft suggestions of what to learn about;
everyone may have different resources that "click" for them, so stick to what helps you.
With that said, there does not exist a resource that makes anything "easy"; there is not
a replacement for persistance and asking for help when you get stuck.
